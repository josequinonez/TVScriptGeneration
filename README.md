# TVScriptGeneration
Predict the content of a Seinfield TV script using RNNs based on historical scripts from nine seasons 

This is a project assignment from **Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program**.

The project is aimed to generate Seinfeld TV scripts with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will recognize patterns during training to predict (generate) a "fake" but likely TV script.

Most of the code and the helper functions are already provided by Udacity.

Data requirements:
- Create a folder "data"
- Download Seinfeld_Scripts.txt to "data"

Library requirements:
- problem_unittests.py
- helper.py
- torch
